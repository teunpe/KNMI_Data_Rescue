This is the readme file attached to the digitized data from the meteorological diary of prof. Edward Wigglesworth, Cambridge (Ma., USA).

The digitization of the data is reported in:
van der Schrier, G. and Jones, P. D. (2008) Daily temperature and pressure series for Salem, Massachusetts(1786-1829), Climatic Change 87:499-515, doi:10.1007/s10584-007-9292-x
Please refer to this study for details regarding Prof. Wigglesworth and his meteorological diary.  Please cite this study when using this data. 

*Description of the data*
The datafiles are:
-) wigglesworth.introduction.txt
-) wigglesworth.1786-1789.dat
-) wigglesworth.pressure.dat
-) wigglesworth.temperature.dat

The Wigglesworth data are digitized from photographs of Wigglesworth's
original handwritten meteorological diary. The photographs are in the
collection of files from prof. Hubert Lamb of the Climatic Research Unit and presumably ordered for his SLP reconstruction (Lamb and Johnson 1959).

The file wigglesworth.introduction.txt contains a transcription of the
introduction Wigglesworth wrote in his meteorological diary. This contains
metadata on positions etc. of the instruments. Quite a few words were illegible on these photographs, which resulted in many "?" which were inserted to denote an illegible word.

The file wigglesworth.1786-1789.dat contains pressure readings and indoors and outdoor temperatures are a reflection of the data originally entered in the Wigglesworth diary. The format of this file is:
   yyyy  Month  
 1   pres  pres  pres  ite  ite  ite  ote  ote  ote 
 .   .     .     .     .    .    .    .    .    .
31   pres  pres  pres  ite  ite  ite  ote  ote  ote 
where "pres" are the pressure readings, "ite" are the indoor temperature
readings and "ote" are the outdoors temperature readings. The observations are made at 8 AM, 1PM and 9PM throughout the record.

The absent values for pressure is "-99.99" and for temperature "-99.0"

The files wigglesworth.pressure.dat and wigglesworth.temperature.dat give the pressure and temperatures in mbar with one decimal place and in degrees centigrade with two decimals.  Absent values in the pressure records are "9999.9" and in the temperature record "-99.00".
